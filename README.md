# Sign-Up-Database-Simulator
A sign in/up page that simulates a database for account information everytime you sign up.

## ABOUT
This project was created around 4 months ago. At the time I was learning about local storage and how objects work in Javascript. I also wanted to simulate a database which I was successful at. This project taught me how to create elements in Javascript when they were needed instead of making a million elements on an HTML file. I did dabble in creating custom console commands and page alerts which were new for me.

## BUILT WITH
- Javascript
- JQuery
- HTML5
- CSS
